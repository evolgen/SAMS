## Workflow used to compare mutation spectrum using maf files

This repository includes scripts used for the mutation spectrum analysis from maf files. 
The workflow for calculating the mutation spectrum is run with additional Rscripts, not currently here. 
Let's keep this as a checkpoint for now!!!

There are several helpful supplementary scripts for maf manipulation or filtering in the **misc** directory.
